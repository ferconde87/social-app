# README

Welcome to the Social App Repository!

My name is Fernando and I'm refreshing my knowledge of Ruby On Rails while I'm trying to do a cool app at the same time.


Todo list:

 - [x] Post with commentaries with like/dislike buttons on them
 - [ ] AJAX Request for creating and deleting post.
 - [ ] Log in / Sign up using Instagram.


 Other ideas:

 - Statistical data about followers. 
 - Graphic of new followers per day, per week, per month.  
 - Average likes per post, most liked post, least liked  post. 
 - Followers who 'likes' posts more often "fans".
 - Followers who 'likes' posts less often "fans" or does not like at all.
